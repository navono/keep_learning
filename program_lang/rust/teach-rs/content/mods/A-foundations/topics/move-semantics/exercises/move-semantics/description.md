*This exercise is adapted from the [move semantics exercise](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises/move_semantics) from Rustlings*


This exercise enables you to practise with move semantics. It works similarly to exercise `A.1`. To get started, `exercises/A/2-move-semantics` in your editor and run
```bash
cargo run --bin 01
```

`01.rs` should compile as is, but you'll have to make sure the others compile as well. For some exercises, instructions are included as doc comments at the top of the file. Make sure to adhere to them.
